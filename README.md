# identicon-generator
This bash-script generates an identicon from your login-name or ldap-name

It basicly takes your input (as a string) and translates it via md5sum into a hashvalue.

This is version 1.0 and i try do update it frequently

How to:
  
  install this git-repo:
  
      git clone https://github.com/junglert/identicon-generator.git
  
  let the script do its magic:
  
      Enter your github loginname or an LDAP, etc. 
      The script will automaticly create a link to githubs identicon parser.
      Right click on the link and select open with browser xy and voila,
      you have your personal identicon made from the hash of your loginname.


Future plans:

  script creates own alias
  help-page
